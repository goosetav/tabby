## How to use Tabby
* You'll probably want to pin Tabby in the browser bar. To do this click the extension icon in the top-right (looks like a puzzle piece) and  then click the "pin" next to the Tabby icon.
* Click the Tabby icon to show the side panel
* The buttons at the top will manipulate the tabs
  * Merge will merge all tabs into the current window.
  * Sort will order the tabs alphabetically by URL.
  * Dedupe will close any tabs with the same URL
* Clicking a tab name in the list will navigate to that tab. Handy if you have lots of open tabs and can no longer see their names.
* Hovering and clicking the tab icon in the list will close that tab. This is useful for cleanig up tabs quickly.
